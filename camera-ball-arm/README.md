# Camera arm with ball joint

These components are based off a previous design by 3dkarma published under CC BY-SA: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:247590

The modifications that have been made to those designs:

## Clip

 - A new clip has been added to mount the camera on a square post

## Camera front

 - The hole has been expanded to fit a significantly larger camera lens

## Camera back

 - The camera back has been hollowed out to support a larger camera module

## Link, Ball Socket and Ball Joint

 - No changes

## Limitations

The camera front and back pieces do not click together currently due to internal changes, and I've used a rubber band to ensure these stay in place. I haven't had a chace to iterate on this further due to time constraints.
