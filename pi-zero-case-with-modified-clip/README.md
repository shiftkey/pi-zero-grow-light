# Raspberry Pi Zero case v2

These components are based off a previous design from Adafruit which is published under the CC BY license: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1165227

The customizations from those designs are:

## Back

 - A clip with notch has been added to the back, so the case can be attached to the side of a container
 - A slot has been exposed for the CSI camera interface cable to connect to the device

 ## Front

 - The slot for the 40 pin header has been covered
